# Banker's Algorithm Simulation

This project is a website that simulates the Banker's Algorithm using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Banker's Algorithm

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm used in operating systems. It is used to determine whether a system is in a safe state by checking if there is a safe sequence of resource allocation.

## Project Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the website.
- `code.js`: The JavaScript file that implements the Banker's Algorithm simulation.

## Example and Screenshots

You can find an example of the Banker's Algorithm simulation in the `Input_Output.pdf` file. It includes the input and output screenshots of the simulation.

## Deployment

The project has been deployed and you can access it [here](https://arunimabarik75.github.io/Bankers-Algorithm/).
